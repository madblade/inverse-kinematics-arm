<p>
    The Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem is the problem of finding a robotic arm’s configuration
    in order for this arm’s end point to reach a target.

<p>
    While it is easy to compute an analytical solution when the arm
    only contains two bones, it quickly becomes impractical as the number of bones increases.
    There are multiple ways, however, to numerically solve the IK problem with arbitrary many bones.
</p>

<p>
    One first method is called Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD).

    Another method is Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK).
