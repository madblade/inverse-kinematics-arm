<p>
    The Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem is the problem of finding a robotic arm’s configuration
    in order for this arm’s end point to reach a target.

<p>
    While it is easy to compute an analytical solution to the IK problem when the arm
    only contains two bones, it quickly becomes impractical as the number of bones increases.
    There are multiple ways, however, to numerically solve the IK problem with arbitrary many bones.
</p>

<p>
    One first method is called <b>CCD</b> (Cyclic Coordinate Descent).
</p>

<!-- CCD demo -->
<div class="view" id="demo-1">

<p class="legend">Move the cube around with your mouse to see CCD in action.</p>
<br/>

<p>
    As a matter of fact, and as you can see from the demo, CCD runs pretty fast,
    gives smooth transitions as the target moves around, and also happens to be easy
    to implement.

    On the demo, it also gives some twist to the robotic arm:
    if you repeatedly move the target in circles,
    the arm will eventually get twisted as a helix.
</p>
<p>
    This is because it works in quaternion space (~i.e. just works with angles),
    and only looks at the quaternions from the last found solution.
    This is a local process.
    A solution to that problem would be to add constraints to the
    joint angles, as we will see in just a bit.
</p>

<p>
    Another method is FABRIK (Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics).

</div>

<p>
    As CCD, FABRIK performs locally: it can hit a local optimum
    and never get out of it. This is because the IK promlem is non-convex, and
    ideally heuristic methods such as FABRIK and CCD should
    annealing, as advised by
